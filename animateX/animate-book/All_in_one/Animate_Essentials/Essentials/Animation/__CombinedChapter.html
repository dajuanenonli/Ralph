      Not that long ago, the field of animated web content was dominated by Flash. But throughout the last years, things have changed dramatically. By now, the first choice for animations on the web lies in web standards, which means mainly DOM manipulation via JavaScript and CSS. Flash on the other hand is now mainly used for high performance video and gaming.

      </p><p>
      Thanks to Edge Animate, creating animations based on JavaScript and CSS has become fairly easy and doesn't even require to write code manually. But why would you want to use animations at all in the first place? On the one hand, it obviously makes your content more attractive and enganging. It can also be quite more than just aesthetics, since animations can be used to better convey your message, guide the user and improve the overall experience. The key however is to not overdue it and use animations wisely. Just because you can, doesn't always mean you should ;)

      <h3 id="anchor_vhte4qp8pvi">Use cases</h3>Animations can be used in all sorts of occasions. Some familiar examples are menus that slide in and out of view, image slider or the different states of interactive elements. More advances applications can be for example infographics or even story telling.
    </p>
    <p><br>
      <h3 id="anchor_aj5smoyldi">Familiarity: Edge Animate, After Effects and Flash</h3>In case you are already familiar with animation tools like After Effects or Flash, you will most likely get used to creating animations with Edge Animate real quickly. There are several similarities, like the use of Keyframes and working with a timeline, which makes it easy to adopt knowledge from those tools. The visual user interface and instant preview also allow you to create very intuitively. 
    </p>
    <p>Still there are some differences when working with Edge Animate. For instance the fact that you work in a browser environment and animating with web standards might require some practice. Using the pin tool and nested symbols are also rather unique concepts, that are very powerful but challenging at the beginning. But don't worry, you will learn all you need to know for creating awesome animations with Edge Animate in this chapter.</p>

<section class="widget text">  <h2 id="anchor_dr2t9pmn29">Recap: The Timeline</h2>  
      <p>
        Animations in Edge Animate are represented on the <i>Timeline</i>. Here you can see all the <i>Keyframes</i>, <i>Transitions</i> and <i>Animation Tracks</i> for animated elements in a chronological order. Chronological means from left to right and everything that is placed underneath one another takes place at the same time. The red line underneath the <i>playhead</i> illustrates this, as it stretches across all tracks while indicating the current position of the playhead.

        A very useful aspect of animating in Edge Animate is the instant preview in the design view. The display is related to the position of the playhead on the timeline, which means you can define the states visually on the stage and move the playhead back and forth to see the result. You can also play the composition to watch the animation already in the design view.
      </p>
      <p>
        This gives you precise control over the choreography of your animations and allows you to adjust timing and duration as well as the arrangement of the single animation tracks. Another great advantage here is that you can edit and tweak the animations right on the timeline, which makes it even faster and easier to get the timing right.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the greatest features of Edge Animate is the fact that you can have more than one timeline. This is because each symbol has its own, independent timeline. All timelines work in the same way, but you can store different animations on each timeline, allowing you to create asynchronous animations and complex choreographies. We will come back to this a bit later in this chapter.

<section class="widget text">  <h2 id="anchor_0ipbqmbcsor">Keyframes</h2>  
      <p>
        Animations in Edge Animate are realized through <i>Keyframes</i>. These keyframes are used to store a property value at a specific point in time on the timeline. Keyframes are represented by diamond shaped icons. When the playhead reaches the position of a keyframe, the corresponding property is set to the value stored in that particular keyframe. The change of values between two keyframes then creates an animation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This leads to the question which values a keyframe could store. The answer is fairly easy: <i>Almost every property in Animate can be stored in a keyframe and therefore be animated</i>. Obvious examples are changing the position of an element or its size. But also background color, border radius or scaling can be animated. Whenever you see the keyframe diamond next to a property value, you can set a keyframe for this value. This gives quite the options for interesting animations and effects. Some of which will be shown later in examples.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        <h3 id="anchor_uvc6h3bx1or">Animating with keyframes</h3>Now let's see keyframes in action and use them to create a simple animation. For starters, we want to move a plain element from left to right. The corresponding property is the position of the element on the X-axis, or in terms of CSS: <i>left</i>. We select the appropriate element that is to be animated, like in this case a red ellipse. We can then use the Keyframe icon next to the property to store that value as starting point by clicking on it.

        Accordingly, a keyframe is created on the timeline at the current position of the playhead. In our example here it should be set at the very beginning of the timeline. <i>Tip: </i> You can always reposition keyframes on the timeline by simply dragging them to a new location. So if you accidentally set the keyframe someplace else, you can simply move it to the beginning of the timeline.

        This is the starting point of our animation. As a next step, define the end position of the animation and store it in another keyframe. In order to do this, move the playhead on the timeline to the favored point in time, e.g. at 1,000 milliseconds. When we now move the element to its final position, a new keyframe is created automatically (as the <i>Auto-Keyframe Mode</i> is activated when setting the first keyframe). As you can see, this second keyframe stores the value of the new left position, and a <i>Transition</i> is created in between.

        This <i>Transition</i> calculates each position between the two keyframes, so that the movement of the object appears to be steady and smooth. You can check the created animation right in the design view by using the play button or by hitting the space bar.
      </p>
      <p>Note that you can use more then one keyframe for each animation track and that you can animate multiple properties at the same time. This would be the case when you change the position on the Y-axis as well, for instance. Go ahead and experiment a little with the different options to get a feeling for how these animations work.</p>

      <p><h3 id="anchor_ypqd63fecdi">Editing existing keyframes</h3>
        Now that we have learned how to set keyframes, it is likely that you would also want to know how to change their values and how to remove them as well. We have already learned that we can simply move and re-position them on the timeline. This allows you for example to modify the duration of the animation: The closer two keyframes are to one another, the quicker the animation will be. Note that you can also copy and paste keyframes, for example to apply them to other elements as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you want to change the value stored in a keyframe, you have to move the playhead to that location. Then you can either make the change in the design view - e.g. move the element around - or change the value immediately in the Timeline track by clicking on the value and typing in a new one.

<section class="widget text">  <h2 id="anchor_65uup0c0udi">Transitions</h2>  
      <p>
        We have already encountered transitions in the previous section. Now let's talk a bit more about their functions and the options they offer us. Transitions are usually created automatically whenever we form a new animation, since in most of the cases, we want to generate the states in between two keyframes as a smooth animation.  
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some occasions, however, where you don't want to have such transitions but rather a rapid change from one state to another. Then you can switch off the <i>Auto-Transition Mode</i> in the <i>Timeline Options</i> (the green bar next to the stop watch icon). Now you only set the keyframes without adding a transition bar in between.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what if you already have a transition bar? Well, that's not a problem at all. You can always add and remove transitions between two keyframes by right clicking on one of the two keyframes or the transition bar and choosing the option in the appearing menu.

        <i>Tip:</i> With the last option in this menu, you can also <i>invert</i> the Transition. As a result, the two corresponding keyframes are simply switched, so that the animation now is going in the exact opposite direction as before. This can be very handy, since you are likely to accidentally animate in the wrong direction, especially when working with the <i>Pin Tool</i>.
      </p>
    </section><!-- /Widget -->

<!-- Widget: Text -->
<section class="widget text">  <h2 id="anchor_5nnboekx1or">Pin tool</h2>  
      <p>
        The <i>Pin Tool</i> is a very useful feature for creating animations in Edge Animate. It might be a bit tricky to get used to at first, but once you've got the hang of it, you most likely don't want to animate without it anymore. We have already learned about activating and deactivating the Pin in the <i>User Interface</i> section. As a reminder: The most convenient way is by double-clicking on the playhead or using the "P" key on your keyboard.   
      </p>
      <p>
        The advantage of using the Pin is that it freezes all properties at its very location. You can then move the playhead to a different point in time to make alterations. All changes then appear as animation tracks between pin and playhead. Notice the "rubber band" that stretches between the pin and the playhead. It is indicating both the direction and duration of the animation. Yes, you can use the pin to animate into both directions: Towards the state fixed with the pin or from that state to the new state (the state created at the current playhead position).
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's take a look at both options and use the pin to animate this basic shape: 
      </p>
    </section><!-- /Widget -->

  <!-- Widget: Text -->
  

<!-- Widget: Text -->
<section class="widget text">    
      <p>
        The more intuitive way (and recommended especially for beginners) is to use the pin to store the initial state and animate towards a new state. Therefore we activate the pin <strong>(1)</strong> and move the playhead to the right <strong>(2)</strong>. In this case, the bar ("rubber band") between pin and pleahead is yellow, with arrows to the right side.

        The changes you make are always referring to the current position of the playhead. Since we have the initial state fixed with the pin, we can now go ahead and create the final state of the animation. For this example move the shape on the design view to the bottom right corner:

        As you can see, the animation tracks and keyframes are added automatically, for every property that is affected. This is way more efficient than having to set keyframes yourself. And since you don't have to worry about that, you have more time to focus on the creative part.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you now run the animation (short cut: space bar), you will see that the shape moves from the left hand side to the bottom right.  
      </p>

        Let's have a quick look at the second option now as well. Therefore we start all over from the beginning with just a shape on the stage. Again, we activate the Pin, but this time we don't move the Playhead to the right but the Pin. Just like the Playhead, it can be moved by clicking and dragging it to a new position. Notice that the bar between Playhead and Pin now is in a blue color and the arrows are facing to the left.

        Now we again move the shape to a new location in the bottom right of the stage. As before, animation tracks and keyframes are added automatically. This time, however, the animation will go into the opposite direction, as you can see in the preview.

        This is because <i>the Pin now stores the final state of the animation, while the initial state is created at the Playhead position</i>. This can be rather confusing. Therefore we recommend using the former option only, so make sure that the "rubber band" is always yellow when using the Pin.

      <p>
        We have already learned that you can move the Playhead and the Pin individually to set the duration of your animation. In some cases you might want to use the exact same duration at a different point in time again. Here's another helpful tip for you: You can <i>move the entire duration by clicking and dragging the "rubber band"</i>. This way, the Playhead and Pin will be moved simultaneously, while the distance between them remains the same.

      <p>
        We have now learned how to create basic animations in Edge Animate. But as you might have noticed, they appear to be rather unrealistic as they use the same speed throughout the entire movement. This kind of animation is called <i>linear</i>. In the "real world", such linear movements are very rare. Most of the times, movements accelerate and/or slow down. Fortunately, you can adopt such a behavior with the help of <i>Easings</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to apply an easing function to an animation, you first have to select the according animation track. Then open up the <i>Easings menu</i> in the <i>Timeline options</i> section:

        There are several options to choose from in order to get the right easing function for your animation. As we have already seen, the default setting is linear. Apart from that, we have the general options <i>Ease In</i>, <i>Ease Out</i>, <i>Ease In Out</i> and <i>Swing</i>. Once you select one of these options, you can set the precise curve, which means the way the easing behaves (not available for linear and swing).

        It is quite easy to find the right options thanks to the curve drawn in the preview window. In general, <i>Ease-In</i> means that the animation becomes throughout the animation. This would be the right option for animating something that is falling down, for example. <i>Ease-Out</i> on the other hand results in a slowing down of the animation. A typical example from real life could be an elevator reaching the destination. As you have probably already guessed, <i>Ease-In-Out</i> is a combination of both: Starting slow, gaining speed and then slowing down in the end. The last option, <i>Swing</i>, is basically another <i>Ease-Out</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Caution:</i> Once you set Easings for an animation track, this easing becomes the new default for all further animation tracks! Be careful to set it back to <i>linear</i> to avoid unexpected animation behavior. Also note that the visual effect of the easing functions depend on the duration of the animation as well as the difference between the keyframe values.

      <p>
        Another option to create even more realistic animations is by using <i>Motion Paths</i>. The animations wie have covered so far referred to straight transitions from A to B. With Motion Paths, you can define the path along which the animation is to take place. Note that Motion Paths are only available for animating the <i>Position</i> of an element. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to create a motion path, select an element that is to be animated and change the <i>Transition Mode</i> in the Property Inspector to <i>Motion Paths</i>.

        Once the Motion Path option is selected, you have only one Keyframe for the <i>Location</i> of the element instead of one for the X and one for the Y position.

      Especially when it comes to creating complex animation choreographies, the potentials of <i>Symbols</i> within Edge Animate becomes obvious. They allow us to stage asynchronous animations on their independent timeline. Symbols have their own scope, as we have already learned in the previous chapter. Still they can be linked to incidents on the main timeline, so that different animations can relate to each other. <br><strong>That's worth having a closer look at.</strong>
    </p>

<section class="widget text">    
    <p><h3 id="anchor_ffxttzc9pb9">Symbol Timeline</h3>
      As we already know, symbols serve as a sort of composition within the composition. As such, they have their own <i>Timeline</i>, which allows us to create animations that are encapsulated within that particular symbol. This makes it possible to treat this animation as a closed entity, like a module, and even reuse or export it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Timeline</i> itself works in the same way as with the main composition. You can create Keyframes and produce Transitions and so on, just like we just learned. In short: You can use the Timeline to create an independent animation choreography. One of the key aspects here is the option to enable or disable <i>autoplay</i> for the Symbol Timeline. This way you can decide whether the animation should start playing right away (as soon as it is placed on the stage) or whether it should wait for a certain event until starting to play. This is what you would call an <i>asynchronous</i> animation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now why would you need this in the first place? A good example is an <i>animation loop</i>, that can be contained within a Symbol. This way, the looped animation is independent of the main Timeline, which can therefore be used to create the main composition. We will show you how you can create such an animation loop shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another good example for the use of asynchronous animations is a button with different states. These different states can be animated on the symbol level and then be played on specific user events, like mouse-enter. You wouldn't want the button to change the states on its own now, would you? We have included a corresponding tutorial in the <i>recipe</i> section for you. Here is the result as example:

<!-- Widget: Text -->
<section class="widget text">    
    <p>
      Keep in mind that you can also <i>contain symbols within other symbols</i> and therefore create complex constructions. Imagine an animated message box, which is going to appear on a certain event. This message box might then include some buttons and other symbols with further animations...and so on. You probably get the point.

        When you set a Trigger, a <i>code window</i> will instantly open up, in which you can define the action that is going to be triggered at that point in time. We will discuss the different options in the <i>Interactivity</i> chapter. For now it is important to remember that a Trigger allows you to execute actions at a specific point in time.

        The position of the Trigger on the Timeline can be changed by simply moving it on the timeline. This allows you to get the right timing for your action, even in complex choreographies. The big advantage is that the animation tracks and the timeline as a whole provide you with a clear indication of what is going to happen when.

      <p><h3 id="anchor_hglv94cmcxr">Trigger and the preview in Animate</h3>
        One last important thing that needs to be mentioned here is that <i>the script within the Trigger is only executed during runtime</i>. That means that you won't see the result when you play your composition in Edge Animate. You have preview it in the browser to see the effect of the Trigger.

      <p>
        Another way of controlling your animations is by using <i>Playback Commands</i>. They can be used to control the playback of a symbols' timeline from the outer scope, for example the main timeline. Playback Commands are especially useful in combination with Labels when they are set in the targeted symbol, i.e. on that symbol's timeline. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever you have a symbol on the stage, you can find the option to add Playback Commands as topmost animation track. You can access the options by clicking on the "+" icon.

        These options refer to the playback of the Timeline of that Symbol. When selected, the particular option is stored at the current position of the Playhead on the current Timeline. This leads to the fact that this particular Playback Command is being executed when the Playhead reaches that particular point. As a result, this is allowing you to control and coordinate an asynchronous playback of different Timelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, the Playback Commands can be devided into three types: <i>Play</i>, <i>Play Reverse</i> and <i>Stop</i>. When you insert a Playback Command on the timeline, a corresponding icon is being placed. This icon is already indicating the type, be it Play, Stop or Play Reverse. In case of Play and Play Reverse, the duration of the playback is indicated with shaded arrows.

        All three types can either refer to the current position of the symbol's Playhead or to a specific location. In this case choose <i>Play From</i>, <i>Play Reverse From</i> or <i>Stop At.</i>. This will first move the Playhead in the Symbol to the given location and then execute the command. The location can be provided as a timestamp (in milliseconds) or as a Label.

        The position of the Playback Commands on the Timeline can be modified in the familiar way: Just grab it with the mouse an put it to the new position. This way you can make sure that the playback of the symbol falls in line with the playback of the main composition.
