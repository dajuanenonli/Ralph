      This chapter will show you how you can publish your Edge Animate projects and what you should consider for the different options. You will learn therefore learn which settings you should use for each purpose. Be it exporting for web, as widget or as special deployment package for use in Muse, Dreamweaver or Wordpress/Drupal - this chapter will guide you the way.

    <h2 id="anchor_mlrwpv0wwmi">Why publish the project?</h2>
    <p>There are a couple of reasons to actually <i>publish</i> your Animate project after you have finished it and to not use the project files as such, although they already work in a web environment. The main reason here is that the working project is not optimized before it is published. Also, publishing allows you to make important settings like enabling or disabling CDN hosting.
    </p>
    <p><h3 id="anchor_wo9ql62bj4i">What is CDN hosting?</h3>
      All Animate compositions have one thing in common: They rely on the <i>Edge Animate runtime</i> to work. This runtime is the core that provides the functionality and API. Since this foundation is the same for all Animate compositions, you don't need to carry it around all the time. This is where the CDN servers come into play: They provide the runtime at the nearest location, so that the user gets it as fast as possible. The upside is a smaller file size (on your server) and a faster download for the user. The disadvantage is that an Internet connection is required, so that your composition will only work when the user is online. Therefore you have to choose wisely. If in doubt, disable this option so that the runtime will be provided along with the composition.

<section class="widget text">  <h2 id="anchor_hmps6kr19k9">Publish Settings: Dialog</h2>  
      <p>
        Before actually publishing your Animate project, you should take a look at the <i>publish settings</i>. These settings are available through the <i>publish settings dialog</i>. Here you can select the context (web, other tools, widget) and get access to further options like CDN hosting.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can access the publish settings through the main menu. Go to "File > Publish Settings..." to open up the corresponding dialog.
      </p>

      <p>
        The different contexts are available through the checkboxes on the left hand side under <i>Publish Target</i>. You can select more than one target at a time. The options available in the dialog vary from target to target, so that you have different settings for web, deployment package and iBooks / OS X widgets.
      </p>
        <h3 id="anchor_4o0ie2vs4i">Save and Publish</h3>
      <p>Keep in mind that this dialog enables you to set your <i>publish settings</i>. When you hit "save", you only save the settings you made. To actually <i>publish</i> your project according to these settings, you have to click on "publish" on the bottom left. This is unfortunately in fact a bit misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Hint:</i> Once you have made and saved your publish settings, you don't have to go back to the dialog to publish it. You can simply go to "File > Publish".

<section class="widget text">  <h2 id="anchor_h8izfxenrk9">Web and optimized HTML</h2>  
      <p>
        The first and probably most frequently used target option is to publish for the web and as optimized HTML, so let's take a closer look at it here. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Animate composition as it is is already able to run in a browser, the project should be published before used in the final web and HTML target. That is because your working project is not yet optimized and contains for example the AN file, which you don't need in the published project. Also you can make useful settings and adjustments, which we will quickly walk through here.
      </p>
      <p><h3 id="anchor_cw8aku1h5mi">Target Directory</h3>
        Select the target directory for your published project. By default it is published in an new folder called "publish/web" in the same directory as your current project. But you can choose any location you like.
      </p>
      <p><h3 id="anchor_lsu6f4unmi">Asset organization</h3>
        Since Edge Animate is managing the assets included in your project like images, videos and scripts, it will include them into the published project as well. In this section you can define the name of the corresponding folders for each file type to make it fit to your targets' usual structure.
      </p>
      <p><h3 id="anchor_dd8fflxr">Host runtime files on Adobe CDN</h3>
        With this option enabled, the published project will download and use the Edge Animate runtime that is hosted on a CDN server, which will allow your content to download faster. This means that an Internet connection is required for the composition to run. Uncheck the option if your files need to run without an Internet connection or if you are using your own hosting.
      </p>
      <p><h3 id="anchor_qvdhn09t3xr">Publish content as static HTML</h3>
        By default, the entire HTML structure of your composition gets injected at runtime via JavaScript. With this option enabled, the content will already be placed as static HTML, so that the output already resambles the composition structure and make the text elements indexable.
      </p>

<section class="widget text">  <h2 id="anchor_0lld5wb3xr">Animate Deployment Package</h2>  
      <p>
        The Animate Deployment Package is a special format that packs your project into a single file (.OAM) and allows you to import and use your Animate composition in other tools like Dreamweaver and Muse. Thanks to a plug-in written by Timm Jansen, you can also use this format to easily include your Animate composition into Wordpress and Drupal.

      <p><h3 id="anchor_0ij8aicc8fr">Target Directory</h3>
        As with web / HTML published files, you can set the target directory for the Animate Deployment Package in the publish settings.
      </p>
      <p><h3 id="anchor_fw9si82gldi">Published Name</h3>
        Since the published package will be only be a single file, you can set the name here. By default, the .OAM file will have the same name as the html file of your project.
      </p>
      <p><h3 id="anchor_34c305ghkt9">Poster Image</h3>
        Here you can set an image that will be displayed when the package is placed inside of other tools.
      </p>
      <p><h3 id="anchor_u44qb0529">Host runtime files on Adobe CDN</h3>
        This option has the same effect as with the web / HTML target option. When enabled, the composition will use the CDN version of the Edge Animate runtime, resulting in smaller file size and faster downloads but making an Internet connection necessary.

<section class="widget text">  <h2 id="anchor_w9i0zy9cnmi">iBooks / OS X</h2>  
      <p>
        The third option to publish an Animate project is to create a <i>.wdgt</i> file, allowing you to use the composition for iBooks or as dashboard widget on OS X.
      </p>

        The <i>stettings</i> here are similar to the ones we already discussed: You can select a Target directory, define a Name for the published project and select a Poster Image.

        Once you have set your publish settings, you can finally hit the "Publish" button in the dialog or choose "File > Publish" in the menu. The appropriate folders will then being created and can then be used in the desired context.
