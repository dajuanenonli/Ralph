      Welcome to your first practical experience with Edge Animate. Before we go further into detailed information about the tool and its functions, we want to give you a quick kickstart of working with the tool and a hands-on introduction. In this guided tutorial you will create your first animation, add a link to an external website and learn how you can run the project in a browser. Plain and simple. Here is what the final project looks like:

      <ol>
        <li>Start by opening the project folder of this tutorial. It already consists a prepared Animate project. Simply double click on the AN file to open the project in Edge Animate.</li>
        <li>The composition already contains the neccessary assets in the images folder. Yet the stage is still empty as there are no assets placed. Go to the right hand side of the interface. There you will find the Library, that contains the items in the “Images” section.</li>
        <li>First of all, place the background image by dragging it onto the stage.</li>
        <li>Then search for the item “ATable.png”. Drag it onto the stage and place it fairly into the center.</li>
        <li>Go back to the Library and look for “Hotspot.png”. Place this item on top of the stage, again simply with drag and drop.</li>
        <li>Now look for the Lady.png and place it on the left side in the grey area beside the stage. This way we can use an animation to let her appear from the off. And here’s how we do it:
          <ol>
            <li>On the left side, you see the property inspector. Make sure that the Lady is selected (blue box around the image, otherwise click on it once again). Look for the X in the property inspector and click on the small diamond shaped button next to it. This will create a keyframe for the position of the image on the X-Achsis.</li>
            <li>At the bottom, you see the timeline with a playhead. Click on the playhead (the yellow handle above the red line), and drag it to approximately 1 second (0:01).</li>
            <li>Now hold the shift key pressed and drag the Lady image to the right side of the table. You will see that an animation track (colored bar) will automatically appear on the timeline.</li>
            <li>Press space bar to watch this animation take place.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Finally, we want to use the Hotspot image to serve as a link to an external website.
          <ol>
            <li>Therefore, right-click on the Hotspot.png image.</li>
            <li>In the menu that opens up, look for ‘Open actions for “Hotspot”’ and select it.</li>
            <li>Now a code panel opens up. First of all, we have to choose an <i>event</i> we want to react to. In this case we select "click". Now we can use JavaScript to define what should happen, when the user clicks on the hotspot. Fortunately, we can use predefined snippets for our purpose:
              <ol>
                <li>Click on the option “Links”, and then select “Link in Same Window”. Notice how the necessary code is automatically added in the code view above. Here you can change the URL to your preference, e.g. edgedocks.com, or simply leave it as it is (adobe.com). You can then close the code window, the script is stored automatically and needs no further confirmation.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Finally, we want to indicate that the hotspot is an interactive item by changing the mouse cursor to pointer. Select the hotspot image and click on the button in the cursor section of the property inspector. Now click on the pointer (the hand icon) and hit the button again to close the selection. 
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Almost done. It is now time to save the project. Go to the top menu, select "File" and use “Save as” to save the project in an appropriate location.</li>
        <li>Last but not least we want to see the result in a real browser. Therefore open the File panel in the menu again and select “Preview In Browser”. The composition will now be launched in your default browser.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Voilá, you have just created your first, interactive Animate composition. Congratulations!  
      </p>

      This workshop is a bit more advanced and will teach you how to use Edge Animate for interactive story telling. It combines several aspects of working with Edge Animate: You will learn how to create and control a sprite sheet animation, how to build an animated scenery with a visual parallax effect and how to add interactions with a spotlight overlay. For this last part, we will rely on the Edge Commons extension library, so you will learn how to integrate and use it in an actual project. Here we go!

      <h3 id="anchor_1oybwbchaor">Script</h3>
      <p>Start off your project with a couple of preparations:
        <ol>
          <li>First, set the size of the stage to 600px by 400px and save your project in an appropriate folder.</li>
          <li>Now import the images from the assets folder into your project by copying the subfolders into the images folder of the created project.</li>
          <li>Place the background image onto the stage, so that it fits the left side. It is supposed to be three times larger, so it reaches out of the stage on the right side.</li>
          <li>Make sure that overflow is set to “hidden” for the stage, so that this additional background is not visible in the browser.</li>
          <li>Use the tools to create a rectangle above the stage with the same width and call it “scenes”. This will serve as container for all the assets so that we can move them all at once.</li>
          <li>Go to the elements panel and place the background image into this scene container.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>Now we can take care of our first scene:
        <ol>
          <li>Create a simple animation: Let the speech bubble appear from above.
          <ol>
            <li>Place the speech bubble image and the first steps text above the stage in the center.</li>
            <li>Select both assets, right click on them and use “Group Elements into DIV” to merge them. Make sure they are placed in the “scenes” container.</li>
            <li>Set the playhead to approximately 3 seconds and activate the pin tool.</li>
            <li>Move the playhead 1 second further.</li>
            <li>Create an animation by moving the speech bubble down and onto the stage.</li>
            <li>Select the created animation track and add the easing “Ease Out: Back”.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Create a sprite sheet animation
          <ol>
            <li>Use the rectangle tool to create a new element (100px by 133px)</li>
            <li>Right click on the element and select “Convert to Symbol...”</li>
            <li>Change the name of the symbol to “character” and remove the rectangle to get an empty container.</li>
            <li>Now place the sprite sheet image into this container, so that the first image fits its borders.</li>
            <li>Set a keyframe for the Left position (X-Axis).</li>
            <li>Disable “Auto-Transition Mode”</li>
            <li>Activate the grid for the timeline and set it to 10/second.</li>
            <li>Move the playhead one position further on the grid, move the sprite sheet 100px to the left (-100px on X-Achsis) and create a new keyframe (if not created automatically). Repeat this step for every image of the sprite sheet.</li>
            <li>Set overflow to hidden for the symbol, so that only one image is visible at a time.</li>
            <li>Create a walking loop
              <ol>
                <li>Set a label with the value “walk” a the second keyframe (first instance of the walking movement).</li>
                <li>Move the last 4 keyframes one step further on the grid to get an empty space at the end of the walking movement</li>
                <li>Place a trigger in that very space and enter the action for playing from the label on the timeline: sym.play(“walk”);</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Now you can preview the result in the browser. The character should be walking on the spot.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Go back to the stage scope and animate the character onto stage and under the speech bubble, using the pin tool.</li>
        <li>Letting the character talk:
          <ol>
            <li>Go back into the symbol and place a label above the fourth to last keyframe (where the character first faces the front). Enter “talk” as label tag.</li>
            <li>Move the second last keyframes again one step further on the timeline grid.</li>
            <li>Place a trigger in the gap, to create another loop: sym.play(“talk”);</li>
            <li>Now go back to the stage level and add a playback command (“+” icon next to the character symbol in the timeline control panel) at the end of the character animation (when he reaches the speech bubble). Choose “Play from”, then switch to labels and select “talk”.</li>
          </ol>  
        </li>
        <li>Animate the entire scene and resume walking
          <ol>
            <li>Move the playhead to the right to determine the duration of the character talking.</li>
            <li>Activate the pin and move the playhead appr. 6 seconds to the right.</li>
            <li>Select the “scenes” element and move it 1200px to the left, so that the background now fits the right side of the stage.</li>
            <li>Move the character to the right so that he remains visible on the stage and ends up in the third scene.</li>
            <li>Use the playback commands to resume the walking cycle by selecting “Play from” -> “walk” at the beginning of the animation.</li>
          </ol>  
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Creating a visual parallax effect and animation loop
        <ol>
          <li>To create the second scene, we place all relevant assets (apart from the fish) and distribute them, so that the cloud is in the back and desktop and mobile device are in front of the big screen.</li>
          <li>Now select the laptop and convert it into a symbol, so that we can animate the fish on the independent timeline and create a loop.
            <ol>
              <li>Place the fish image on right side of the desktop screen.</li>
              <li>Activate the pin and animate the fish to the left side of the screen.</li>
              <li>Use the same duration to create another animation shortly afterwards to move the fish back to the start position.</li>
              <li>Select both animation tracks and add the easing “Ease Out: Bounce”</li>
              <li>Now to turn the fish around, first create a keyframe for the Scale(x) property (top property in the “Transform” section in the property inspector)</li>
              <li>Unlink the two values by clicking on the chain symbol on the left</li>
              <li>Move the playhead to the beginning of the second animation track and change orientation by setting Scale(x) to -100%.</li>
              <li>Go to the end of the the animation track and enter a trigger to play again from the beginning: sym.play(0);</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Create a visual parallax:
            <ol>
              <li>Use the pin tool and set again the same duration as for moving the “scenes” element</li>
              <li>now select the laptop and mobile device image and move them a few inches to the left.</li>
              <li>Select the cloud and move it into the opposite direction. This way the assets closer to the front will move further in the same duration, the cloud in the back less far. You might have to test and tweak the distances a little to achieve the intended effect. Remember to deactivate the pin afterwards.</li>
            </ol>

      <p>Adding interactivity and the Edge Commons Spotlight Overlay
        <ol>
          <li>Start by placing the assets for the third scene next to the character onto the stage.</li>
          <li>Stop the character walking sequence using playback commands, this time selecting “Stop At” -> “talk”, so that he just faces the front.</li>
          <li>In order to be able to access the spotlight feature, you need to include jQuery and the Edge Commons library into your project. Therefore, copy the libs folder from the assets folder into your project folder.</li>
          <li>Use the scripts panel in the library to include both script files from disk, starting with jQuery. Therefore click on the “+” icon and search for the appropriate file (jquery-2.0.3.min.js). Then add the EdgeCommons.js file in the same way.</li>
          <li>The libs folder also includes a CSS file that is necessary for the right display of the overlay. Apparently you cannot use the scripts panel to include style sheets, so you have to do it manually:
            <ol>
              <li>Open actions for stage (curly braces next to the stage name) and select compositionReady</li>
              <li>Here you enter the following code to use yepnope to load the style sheet:<br>yepnope({load: “libs/spotlight.css”});
</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Make sure the images for the spotlight lie in the /images folder of your project, otherwise copy them to this location.</li>
          <li>Now open actions for the first interactive element (S3_ani.png)
            <ol>
              <li>select “click”</li>
              <li>and enter the following code:</li>
