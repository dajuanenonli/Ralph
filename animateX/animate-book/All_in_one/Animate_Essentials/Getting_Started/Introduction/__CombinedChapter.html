      <p>
        <strong>Hello Edge enthusiast!</strong><br>Since you have purchased this publication, I can safely assume that you are eager to get to know Edge Animate from inside out and that you can’t wait to create awesome and engaging web content. That is awesome. But before we get started, I would like to take a few moments to introduce you to the underlying intention of this publication and how it works.

      </p><p>
        This publication is considered to be a guide book for working with Edge Animate. It is designed to give a profound introduction to the tool and its functionality as well as the context in which it is to be used. As such, it starts from the very beginning and with the absolute and fundamental basics. There is no previous knowledge required. If you already know a thing or two about Edge Animate, it might be useful to freshen up your knowledge. Also keep in mind, that you don’t have to read the chapters from end to end. It is no problem to jump in and out at any point.
      </p>
      <p>
      In addition to this knowledge base, we have prepared a lot of practical examples and challenges to provide you with insights on how to actually work with the tool in real workflows. Many of the examples given are in fact derived from real life projects and related issues. This will get you up and running for the daily business.
      </p>
      <p>
        But maybe you prefer to get your hands on right away and rather want to explore the tool on your own? No problem: We have included a whole bunch of sample projects and tutorials that just wait to be explored. We also included templates that let you build useful Animate composition for different purposes fast and easy.

    <p>This approach allows you to create animated content that works on all modern browsers and devices. You can use it to create mobile apps and digital publications as well.</p>
    <p><strong>The advantage:</strong> Although you are working directly on a browser instance, there is no coding knowledge required, since the tool comes along with a visual design surface. This is not only comfortable, but also gives you the necessary precision to stage complex animation choreographies with ease.

          Edge Animate is part of the Creative Cloud, Adobe's series of tools and services for the creative workflow. As such it is ideal to breathe life into Photoshop compositions and bring Illustrator graphics into the web. It also works well in combination with InDesign for digital publications or with code editors like Dreamweaver.

        The previous section might already have given you quite an impression on what Edge Animate is about. But who is it actually directed to? Who is supposed to be using it and in which contexts?

        </p><p>
          Despite the first impression, Edge Animate is not entirely directed at (web-)designers, but takes its place in a creative workflow connecting design and interactivity. Its approach invites the whole range from graphic designers (even with little or no experience in regards to web so far) over motion and UX designers up to creative coder and front end developers.

      <p>
        Using Edge Animate gives you the possibility to express creativity in terms of web standards without having to write code yourself. You might actually even learn quite a bit about CSS, HTML and JavaScript along the way without really noticing it. You are on the other hand at no time limited to creating visually, since you can as well introduce code manually at every step of the way. You can also use libraries like jQuery UI to enhance your performance. In general, we have experienced that Edge Animate can be easily adapted into pre-existing workflows.

        <strong>The output of Animate is pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</strong> That makes it highly interesting for a broad spectrum of use cases, not only the web but e-publications (via Digital Publishing Suite or ePub with Adobe InDesign) and apps as well (i.e. using PhoneGap). In short, it introduces a design centric workflow in a so far rather code driven domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet there are some rumors and often heard misconceptions that should be addressed here as well:
      </p>
    </section><!-- /Widget -->       
    
  
  <!-- Widget: Text -->
  

<!-- Widget: Text -->
<section class="widget text">  <h2 id="anchor_0dv128uayvi">5 common misconceptions about Edge Animate</h2>  
      <p>
        <strong>1) Edge Animate is yet another banner tool.</strong><br>
Edge Animate is far more than a simple tool for creating web banners. It allows you to stage complex animation choreographies with independent timelines and triggers and create complex layouts. The openness to custom code and external libraries lets you create interactive elements and even entire applications. It is a full-fledged and versatile tool that is applicable for everyday use in real life projects. Frequent update releases via the Creative Cloud add yet more functionality and comfort.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2) It is only for designers, not for a coder.</strong><br>
The tool offers a visual design surface and offers an easy access to webstandards and animation without requiring coding experience. That does not mean that you can not customize the code as well. When doing so, you are not confined to the built-in code view. You can open the project files in any editor of your choice and introduce your custom code. Animate will recognize and accept the altered code, so you can switch back and forth all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3) Animate is the new Flash.</strong><br>
Although there are similarities between the tools, Animate will not be a replacement for Flash. With web standard based animations, Edge Animate is an entirely different approach and tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4) You may not use the code produced by Edge Animate.</strong><br>
There is an ongoing dispute of whether code that is generated by tools can be considered "clean" and should be used for "real" projects. We don't want to take part or sides in that discussion here. Let us just point out that the  code produced in Edge Animate is JavaScript and encapsulated in seperate files. It is ready for primetime and works across all modern browsers. Plus, you can easily add and alter the code at all time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5) Edge Animate is for websites (only).</strong><br>
Probably the greatest advantage of the recent shift towards web standards and the mobile sector is that they allow the web to spread and develop into new regions. Interactive and animated content can now be found all over the place, like in e-publications and apps. Animate allows you to create engaging content not only for websites but for pretty much all of these deviations as well.

      <h3 id="anchor_qkxt6nzsemi">HTML Animation</h3>
      <p>
        Design expressive, animated content with ease, precision, and realism. Or, you can add motion and interactivity to existing HTML layouts and templates.
      </p><br>
      <h3 id="anchor_6of1fbf0f6r">Precise control</h3>
      <p>
        Design with confidence using an intuitive timeline that offers amazing precision. Edit property-based keyframes and use the innovative Pin to quicken the animation process. Create nested animations with independent timelines using symbols.
      </p><br>
      <h3 id="anchor_e9kqb3p7gb9">Motion paths</h3>
      <p>
        Animate elements along fully customizable, fine-grain motion paths for highly expressive movements. You can also apply easing functions and use motion paths in resizable layouts.
      </p><br>
      <h3 id="anchor_bq81z5gsyvi">Reusable symbols</h3>
      <p>
        Use the symbols feature to create nested animations with independent timelines and interactive capabilities. Symbols are reusable and can be controlled via exposed APIs and pre-built code snippets.
      </p><br>
      <h3 id="anchor_4gkap833di">Mobile ready</h3>
      <p>
        Content created with Edge Animate is designed to work reliably on iOS and Android devices, as well as in modern browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer 9+.
      </p><br>
      <h3 id="anchor_areqoqx5hfr">Multiple publishing options</h3>
      <p>
        Publish with options such as emitting HTML markup for SEO friendliness, choosing whether jQuery should be packaged with the project, or adding a preloader that lets viewers know that content is being downloaded.

<section class="widget text">    
      <p>
        <strong>Modern Browsers Only</strong><br>
Edge Animate supports all modern browsers from Internet Explorer 9 onward. Older versions will not be able to run your Edge Animate composition. In order to not leave an empty space or cause an error, you have the option to display a (very reduced) substitution called “Downlevel stage”. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>File size</strong><br>
Although it no longer requires jQuery, Edge Animate still comes with a comparatively large file size to run in the browser (compared to e.g. a flash animation). Even in simple projects with little or no animation at all, this is too much for some cases, for instance commercial web banners. You should keep this in mind and evaluate if your project might run into trouble regarding download traffic and server sided restrictions. With the latest version Adobe tackled this particular problem, so it might not be so much of a deal anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Performance (DOM manipulation)</strong><br>
The animations created in Edge Animate are basically DOM manipulations – using JavaScript to move elements in the browser window. There are technical limitations regarding performance and speed of such animations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>No support for Canvas/WebGL</strong><br>
Edge Animate only reders to the HTML-DOM. Support for neither Canvas nor WebGL is planned so far. But you can load Canvas content into your Edge Animate compositions with custom JavaScript.
