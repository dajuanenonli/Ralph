Teen Boy Pack (12 movements).

To insert animation into your project just copy/paste desired movieclip from stage or library.
If you enter main movieclip, there you can see several layers, each layer - some part of teen:
- Phones
- Clock  
- Hair
- Eyes
- Skin
- Pants
- Shirt
- Shoes
- Shadow
To change color of some part - just select desired part and use tint blend mode and/or some filters like adjust colors.
I include in pack file "Color Variations.fla" - there you can see some examples of colorizing. You can use my or create your own effects variation for your own style.
Also I include WAV-file with sound loop for teenagers in headphones.
